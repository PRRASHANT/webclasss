                SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan, a method of investing in mutual funds.<br>
                  With a SIP, an investor chooses a mutual fund scheme and invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.
                  <br>The amount is automatically debited from the investor's bank account and invested in the mutual funds at the predetermined time interval.
                  Power of starting SIP early
                  Starting an SIP early in oneâ€™s career can be a strategic move. It allows the individual to accumulate a larger corpus over time due to the power of compounding. This approach also encourages disciplined investing, as a fixed amount is invested at regular intervals. Moreover, it can help in mitigating the impact of market volatility, as more units are purchased when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. This strategy, known as rupee cost averaging, can be effective over the long term. Remember, the key to successful investing is not timing the market, but time spent in the market.

        A "lump sum" is simply the addition of a number of (usually monetary) amounts into a single-number total. <br> In fact "lump sum" is simply a fancy way of saying "single total".<br> This addition may be over time (in the case of the lump sum value of an annuity or perpetuity), or of costs (in an invoice giving only a lump sum total, rather than itemised costs).<br> Regardless, the concept is very simple, and really quite trivial.<br> I have seen (and used) the concept innumerable times in academic Finance, tutoring Maths for Business, working as a Business Analyst, and in Economic consulting -- but never seen anybody bother to discuss or explain the concept itself -- any more than we'd bother to discuss or explain the equals sign.
